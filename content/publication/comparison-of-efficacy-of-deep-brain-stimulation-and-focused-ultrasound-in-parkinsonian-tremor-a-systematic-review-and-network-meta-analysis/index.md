abstract: "To compare the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and
  MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) in parkinsonian tremor. We performed a
  network meta-analysis based on a Bayesian framework. We searched the
  literature for articles published between January 1990 and October 2020 using
  three databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Database of
  Systematic Reviews). MRIgFUS, an efficacious intervention for improving
  parkinsonian tremor, has not demonstrated to be inferior to DBS in
  parkinsonian tremor suppression. Hence, clinicians should distinguish
  individual patients' symptoms to ensure that the appropriate intervention and
  therapeutic approach are applied."
